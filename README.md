# 🐾 eBPF-Watchdog

**eBPF-Watchdog** is a learning-driven project aimed at exploring and harnessing the power of **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** to monitor file system activity. This tool keeps an eye on a specified directory and logs file-level operations such as **create, read, write**, and **delete** in real-time.

> ⚙️ This is my **first eBPF project**, and I’ll be using this repository not just to build the main tool but also to **learn, experiment**, and document everything I understand about eBPF along the way.

## 📚 Project Goals

- ✅ Learn and understand core eBPF concepts and tools  
- ✅ Build a file access monitoring system using eBPF  
- ✅ Log real-time file events with process info  
- ✅ Transfer logs from kernel space to user space  
- ✅ Create a clean, extensible codebase for future enhancements
